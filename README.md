Basic eprom programmer using Arduino Nano.

This is the Arduino scetch needed for an Eprom programmer for 27C256 and 27C512 Eprom chips

This project was put together using bits from other designs. The main aim was just to
get a working programmer for these two chips.

This was used to program Eproms for use with various "Retro" design z80 computers,
mostly based on RC2014 designs.
